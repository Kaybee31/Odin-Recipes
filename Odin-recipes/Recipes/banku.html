    <p> Banku  is a local term in the Ga-Dangme (Ga)-language coined for a cooked slightly fermented mixture of corn-dough and cassava-dough made into dumplings to serve.</p> <p>It is distinctively a Ga-Dangme term. There are similar tonal terms with different meaning in the Ga-language, such as Inku (for pomade in the Ga-language), Ashanku (for a variant of a plantain fritter called 'Tatale' in the Ga-language), and many others ending in 'Ku'.</p>
